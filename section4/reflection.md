## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?


    - I felt good about breaking up my time with short breaks, and being more intentional with my time. Although I got stuck on an exercise late at night, and I kept working on it out of desperation. I probably worked on it past the point of where I should have but it was late and I had set a goal to finish and I was getting increasingly frantic and anxious. I finally decided to call it a night and resume in the morning. When I went back in the morning I realized it was just a simple typo... I think had I been a little less strict about sticking to my goal and realizing when I need to work on something else, or just go to bed and try again, this would not have been so bad.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

    - I think it went okay, it was nice to have an intention and a goal in mind, but I found that when I did get stuck on something or felt like I was running over my time it started to stress me out more than it should have.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

    - An object is more complex than an array, and it does not store the data in a sequential list. Data in arrays can only be accessed based on the order in which they are referenced. However the data in an object can be called and changed and generally much more dynamic than an array.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - Array - because it could easily be represented as a list
  * List of states and their capitals
    - Object - because you want to make sure each capital is associated with their state
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - Object - because you might want to change what you are packing based on where you are going
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - Array - because it is just a list of all the accounts you follow
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - Object - so that you could modify/sort it by the cohort or the name
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Object - so that it can be dynamic and you can scale your cake if you want to make more or less
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - Array because it can easily be represented and sorted as a list, although if you wanted to include the ranking and make it more dynamic you could make it an object

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
    - A shopping cart on an online web store
      - items in cart - these would probably be objects themselves that include an image, price, description, quantity
      - total price
      - estimated tax
1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

    - I ran in to some difficulty with the functions inside of objects/classes, it was hard to find the right syntax for what I was trying to do because it didn't always line up with the syntax I would use outside of an object. For instance I was trying to add a string to an array that was an element inside of my object, and I thought I should use `push` but I could not figure out how to get that to work, it just kept returning my array as a number value. I ended up finally getting the result I wanted using concatenation `+`, I am not sure if that is the correct syntax, but it gave me the result I wanted.
