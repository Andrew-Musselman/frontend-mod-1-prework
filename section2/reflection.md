## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
    I feel like I generally wait too long to ask questions, I am terrified of looking incompetent so I always want to be able to figure things out for myself. I think these blog posts are really helpful in getting a better understanding of how I am not alone in my feelings like this. I think it is very important to be able to figure things out on my own, but also of when to recognize when it is just wasting precious time. It also sheds some light on how it is important to make sure you know what you are asking, and to really listen and understand the answer you are given so that you learn something.


1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
    I like that the supports were removed for this section. I felt when the instructions to run a file in node were present I was copy pasting a lot, but I might be in a different directory and it would throw an error, and then I would have to figure out what to change. Whereas without the instructions I really had to understand what I needed to type in order to run the file in node.

    I also really enjoyed learning about functions from several different outside resources because each one of them explained it in a slightly different way that I think helped me to have a better understanding of them. However this also made me a tad bit uncomfortable because some of the resources used unfamiliar terminology that I felt like I needed to look into further to fully understand.


1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
    A conditional statement is like a branch in a road, if one thing is true you go one direction, if something else is true you go the other direction. An example of this in daily life is waking up for the day, if it is a work day it is important to get out of bed and start getting ready for work, if it isn't a work day there I have a different daily routine to follow. A likely example of this in a web application is if you go to a website that lets you share things on social media it will probably run a script to see if you are already signed in to your social media account, if you are it will take you directly to the post draft, if you are not it will prompt you to log in to your account.


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
    Adding multiple conditions to an `if` statement uses the `else if` function. The first condition is posed as as if this condition is met then do this, then there is a following statement written as `else if` this condition is met then do this, this is repeated for all conditions until all the conditions are accounted for. If you want to script something for if none of the conditions are met you can end with an `else` statement. The program will read all the questions sequentially until it runs into a true statement, and then it will execute the code and not read any of the following conditions. If the first condition is true the program will not read any subsequent conditions.


1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met,
    Logical operators exist as a tool for developers to check whether two conditions are met or if 1 of 2 conditions are met. The `&&` operator will tell the program to check if both conditions are met, and will only return true if both conditions are true. The `||` operator will check if 1 of 2 conditions are met, this will return true unless both conditions are false.


1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
    I don't have any questions about `if` by themselves. I am interested to see how functions and if statements work together. I am also just excited to see the broader uses of these methods and their applications.
