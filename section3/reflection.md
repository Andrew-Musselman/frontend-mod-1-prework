## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
    - The idea that you are not inherently good at things like programming, but they require work and practice. This really resonated with me because there have been so many times where I have started something new and not been good at it and thought to myself that this thing just isn't for me.
    - The idea of struggling being a part of the learning process and not to consider them a waste of time. This really resonated with me because I find myself struggling sometimes with things that turn out to be so simple, and then I feel like I wasted my time on such a silly problem. I need to get better at recognizing that the struggle is part of the learning process and it is not a waste of time.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
    - I feel like I currently am very open to feedback and criticism. I have often found myself seeking it out to make sure I am on the right track with things. Never taking it personally, but always as an opportuninty to grow.
    - I am not very good at putting in the practice. I find that when I am not good at something I get easily frustrated, and want to give up. I need to recognize that this is all part of the growth process and it is imperative that I put in work to get better.

    
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  Mobile or web applications use arrays to store datatypes as a list. Twitter, instagram, facebook, and other social media programs would likely store followers/friends/connections in an array.


1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  Array method are specific keywords that allow you to edit an already existing array. They are specific about whether the add or delete an element and where they add or delete.


1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  A loop is used as an easier way run the same code multiple times, or sequentially with different inputs. You would use a loop on its own if you wanted to run code sequentially or count. You would use a loop in conjunction with an array if you had specific data that you could organize as an array, and you would like to apply the same code to every element in that array.


1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
    A loop is something that tells the computer to repeat the same task again and again for a set number of times.


1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
    - I somehow created an infinite loop and crashed my terminal in one of the loops-arrays exercise. I am not really sure how I did this because I used very similar syntax in all my other array loops, and when I finally fixed it I hadn't really changed much. My main question from this is how do I stop my terminal from running an infinite loop without force quitting? My second question from that is how can I tell if something is going to create an infinite loop before I run it in my terminal?
