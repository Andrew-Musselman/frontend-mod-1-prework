## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  - the Super Super Learner article resonated with me because it really aligned with why I made the choice to go to Turing in the first place. I felt stuck in the my old job and my old way of doing things and I felt like I needed to grow and learn in order to move forward. So really having a growth mindset and forming good learning habits is an important part of how to get there. I always have to remind myself that i need to focus on the journey and what I am learning, instead of the destination.
  - I already looked at learning as a process, and I had a pretty good growth mindset, and I teach what I'm learning to others (most often to my husband, who get's sick of listening to me). I think I can grow these areas even more, specifically the teaching aspect, I feel myself not speaking up enough in class or in the breakout groups even if I know the answers. I think it will be more beneficial to teach someone who is learning the same things as me, and has an understanding of the concepts and wants to learn, rather than unwilling participants (my husband).
  - I do need to get better at reading, and reading more extra things, I want to read all the linked articles in our assigned readings, and really do my best to understand everything. Keep going down the rabbit hole to expand my knowledge even more.
  - I also need to be better about taking care of my brain and taking breaks. I find when I am studying independently I will just cram for hours at a time because I am worried if I take a break I will get distracted and won't go back to work. I also could use some better eating and sleeping habits to take better care of my brain.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  - Number - a data type that handles all numbers both positive and negative, as well as floating points like fractions or decimals. All numbers are written without commas. This data type allows us to do math.
  - String - A data type that contains characters within quotation marks, the quotation marks can be single or double as long as they match. A string may contain numbers, however they will not be able to do any mathematical functions when numbers are in a string.
  - Boolean - A data type that only has two outcomes true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
 `console.log('Hello World!')`
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// Indicates comments in a javascript file. This tells javascript not to read these lines. This function is used to write comments about what specific portions of the code does, or to add notes about parts of code.
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  - A variable is used in coding to temprarily assign a value (data type) to a word for a short period of time, in order to use that word to recall that value.
  - eli5 - a variable turns a word into something that represents something else.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- Twitter:
  * `var screenName = 'Someone's screen name'` - this variable would show the screen name of a user who published a tweet
  * `var timePosted = 11` - This variable would show what time the tweet was published
  * `var location = 'Denver'` - this variable would show where the user tweeted from, but only if they had location services turned on, so there is probably a boolean function at play to determine if this script is run.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
 - concatenation is used to link together strings and variables. To use it we use the + sign. We can use this to link strings with variables and other strings, or variables together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
- Twitter again, they would use concatenation to join the time a tweet was posted, the date the tweet was posted, they type of twitter interface used, and the location the tweet was posted to display all of these together at the bottom of the tweet.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  - I still have a lot of questions about boolean data types, not so much what they are conceptually, but more so how to use them. I feel like it will become clearer the further I get, but right now I am confused.
    - one of the examples was whether or not a password was present, true = prompts the computer to continue false = prompts user to enter password
    - I suppose then it would be used to determine if the password was correct true = matches what is on file - let them in, false = does not match, return an error.
    - I guess I am wondering if boolean will always be used in an if else situation?
